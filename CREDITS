I would like to thank the authors and contributors of fuse-ext2. I took the framework
of fuse-ext2 and started modifying it to work for UFS. It shouldn't come as a surprise
if you see a striking similarity between the directory structure and build system of
fuse-ufs and fuse-ext2. Some of the core allocation routines were taken and modified
from ffs module in ufsutils-7.0.

Special thanks to :-
